# Csvbuilder::Importer

[Csvbuilder::Importer](https://github.com/joel/csvbuilder-importer) is part of the [csvbuilder-collection](https://github.com/joel/csvbuilder)

The importer contains the implementation for importing data from a CSV file.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add csvbuilder-importer

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install csvbuilder-importer

# Usage

Importing data from a CSV is critical and requires two validation layers. First, you need to ensure data from the CSV are correct, and Second, you need to check that data respects the business logic before inserting it into the system.

To do that, `Csvbuilder::Import` use `ActiveModel::Validations` so you can write your validations in the `CsvImportModel`.

```ruby
class UserCsvImportModel
  include Csvbuilder::Model
  include Csvbuilder::Import

  column :first_name
  column :last_name

  validates :first_name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 2 }

  def abort?
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}" == "Bill Gates"
  end
end
```

The import takes the CSV file and the Import class.

```ruby
rows = Csvbuilder::Import::File.new(file.path, UserCsvImportModel).each
row_enumerator = rows.each # It's essential to go through the Enumerator to benefit from the callbacks. See References[^1]
row_model_instance = row_enumerator.next
```

`Csvbuilder::Import` implement two essential methods:

1. skip?
2. abort? # NOTE: abort can be trigger at the importer level too.

You have to provide your implementation of the method `abort?`. If the method `abort?` returns true, the iteration will stop.

By default, `skip?` return true if the `CsvImportClass` is invalid, but it is safe to override. This means the previous iteration will not return any invalid row.

# Integration

Let's say we want to do something useful and add users if those users are valid.

Let's extract the `CsvRowModel` for more clarity:

```ruby
class UserCsvRowModel
  include Csvbuilder::Model

  column :first_name
  column :last_name
end
```

```ruby
class UserCsvImportModel < UserCsvRowModel
  include Csvbuilder::Import

  validates :first_name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 2 }
  validates :last_name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 2 }

  def user
    User.new(first_name: first_name, last_name: last_name)
  end

  # Skip if the row is not valid,
  # the user is not valid or
  # the user already exists
  def skip?
    super || !user.valid? || user.exists?
  end
end
```

Now, we can safely import our users.

```ruby
[
  ["First name", "Last name"],
  ["John"      , "Doe"      ],
]

Csvbuilder::Import::File.new(file.path, UserCsvImportModel).each do |row_model|
  row_model.user.save
end
```

# Advance Integration

`Csvbuilder::Import::File` implement callbacks. It provides the following:

1.  before_each_iteration
2.  around_each_iteration
3.  after_each_iteration
4.  before_next
5.  around_next
6.  after_next
7.  before_abort
8.  before_skip

Let's extend `Csvbuilder::Import::File`

```ruby
class Importer < Csvbuilder::Import::File
  attr_reader :row_in_errors

  def initialize(*args)
    super
    @row_in_errors = RowErrors.new
  end

  after_next do
    next true unless current_row_model # End of File
    next true if current_row_model.valid? # No Errors To Collect

    row_in_errors.append_errors(current_row_model)
  end
end
```

Now the importer can report the errors encountered instead of ignoring them.

For documentation purposes, here is a possible implementation of the errors collector:

```ruby
class RowErrors
  attr_reader :headers, :errors

  def initialize
    @errors = []
  end

  def append_errors(row_model)
    @headers ||= begin
      errors << row_model.class.headers
      row_model.class.headers
    end

    row_in_error = []
    row_model.source_attributes.map do |key, value|
      row_in_error << if row_model.errors.messages[key].present?
                        "Initial Value: [#{value}] - Errors: #{row_model.errors.messages[key].join(", ")}"
                      else
                        value
                      end
    end
    errors << row_in_error
  end
end
```

Now we can nicely show the errors which occur over the import.

```ruby
[
  ["First name", "Last name"],
  ["J", "Doe"]
]

importer.row_in_errors.errors
# => [
# =>   ["First Name", "Last Name"],
# =>   ["Initial Value: [J] - Errors: is too short (minimum is 2 characters)", "Doe"]
# => ]
```

Thanks to the callback mechanism, the opportunities to interact with the import are immense. For instance, you can show the errors on a Web Form and offer the chance to the user to change the data and re-attempt.

For long imports, you can show a progress bar to help customers cope with the import time; as you know, if errors have occurred, you can change the colour of the progress bar accordingly and offer the possibility to stop the import earlier.

## Aborting an import

There is a design challenge to handling an import line-by-line. If it makes the code more efficient and decoupled, we might have cases when we want to check something shared with all lines. The obvious ones are the headers. Let's say we want to check them and abort all imports if something wrong is detected. We probably don't want to add the abort conditioning on every line (Csvbuilder::Model or, more precisely, its extension Csvbuilder::Import). We would rather have it in the Importer itself. In that case, we can stop the Importer from invoking "abort!". Let's consider the following example:

```ruby
class Importer < Csvbuilder::Import::File

  after_next do
    if HeaderChecker.new(current_row_model).invalid?
      abort!
      next true # Keep going into #each and hit the callbacks
    end
  end

end
```

```ruby
context "with incorrect headers" do

  should "not import data" do
    importer = Importer.new(@file.path, @importer_class, @context)

    row_enumerator = importer.each

    assert_raises StopIteration do
      row_enumerator.next
    end
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
